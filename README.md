# todoList
This is the RESTful API for todoList creation,updation,deletion and view.
I have used JPA,H2 for this project.
Tasklists can be viewed using http://localhost:8080/listTasks/{Username}. Username is used as a parameter as no other user should be able to see each others task as a measure of security.
Task can be created using http://localhost:8080/createTask
Task can be modified using http://localhost:8080/editTask
Task can be deleted using http://localhost:8080/DeleteTask/{taskId} taskid has to be provided as we want to delete one single task at a time.
Task has the following fields:
 
    "taskId": int and autogenerated
    "user": string
    "taskName": string
    "description": string
    "status": string
    "createdDate": json date format string(dd-mm-yyyy)
    "updatedDate": json date format string(dd-mm-yyyy)
    
     according to the business logic I made status and updatedate updatable only.
     
     If time provided I would like to add ENUM(started,in Progress,Completed,Reopened) on status and add pagination and sorting for display.
